LINK!
=====

LINK was originally designed to be a free form notetaking application
and to that end, it does an alright job.

The code is a mess. I hacked on it like there was no tomorrow and it
shows.

I make extensive use of Vim's marker code folding to organize the code
so if it looks a little out of hand, try that. It should clear things
up at least a little.

I wish I could spend more time on it but life has other plans for me. I
don't know if I'll ever get a chance to revisit this program so I'm
releasing it as open source to give it one more chance.

It's been a wild ride.

Have fun and enjoy the adventure!
